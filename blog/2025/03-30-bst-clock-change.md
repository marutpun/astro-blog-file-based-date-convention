In the UK the clocks go forward 1 hour at 1am on the last Sunday in March, and back 1 hour at 2am on the last Sunday in October.

The period when the clocks are 1 hour ahead is called **British Summer Time** (BST). Thereâ€™s more daylight in the evenings and less in the mornings (sometimes called Daylight Saving Time).

When the clocks go back, the UK is on **Greenwich Mean Time** (GMT).

Please note, We will go back at 1 hour at 2am on **26 October 2025**
